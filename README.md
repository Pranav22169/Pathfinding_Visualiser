The Pathfinding Visualizer is an innovative and interactive tool designed to 
provide users with a visual understanding of how different pathfinding algorithms 
operate in real-world scenarios. By allowing users to explore routing through 
algorithms such as A*, Dijkstraâ€™s, Greedy Best-First Search (BFS), and Bi
Directional Search, D* lite, Fringe Search , the visualizer serves as an educational 
and practical platform for comparing and understanding the efficiency of these 
techniques. The project emphasizes realistic applications by simulating navigation 
within urban landscapes, offering users insights into the performance and 
optimization of pathfinding algorithms under various geographic and 
infrastructural conditions.
